/*  C++ Basics 11
    
    The next questions are for STL:

    We have a sorted sequence of numbers : 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10...
    What will be the most efficient STL container to use if : 

    1. We need to have a quick read access to any of the elements? Explain why.
    2. We need to quickly add/remove elements preserving the sorted sequence? Explain why.
    3. Associate any of the elements with some data, for example name of a student? Explain why.
